🎨 **Welcome!**

This project is my way of integrating **AI** with something that would conventionally be considered *off the charts*...  
*Hehe, get it? Charts!* 

Inspired by the idea of **visual encryption**, this app uses **YOLOv8** to decode encrypted segments from a poster grid and recover the original image behind the scenes.


Think of it as AI solving a visual puzzle — try uploading one of the encrypted images and watch the magic unfold!

Feel free to use your Camera Directly from this app itself and get a nice zoom on the box of your interest!

By no means was this a perfectly functional project — it was more of a way to test my creativity.

In fact, try uploading a completely random image... you'll still get a confident prediction! 😅  
Which, of course, just means that my model needs more training data — and it should be learning **only from the poster**, not the rest.
